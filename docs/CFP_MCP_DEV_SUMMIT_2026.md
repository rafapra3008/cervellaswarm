### TITOLO

```
CervellaSwarm: Orchestrating 16 Specialized Agents with MCP
```

*(Alternativa: "Building a Self-Reviewing AI Team with MCP: 16 Agents in Production")*

### TRACK

### ABSTRACT

```
What if your AI coding assistant could check its own work?

CervellaSwarm is a production multi-agent system that orchestrates 16 specialized
AI agents through MCP. Unlike single-agent approaches, our architecture separates
execution from validation:

- 12 Worker agents (Sonnet) handle specialized tasks: frontend, backend, testing,
  documentation, security, DevOps, and more
- 3 Guardian agents (Opus) perform quality assurance on every output
- 1 Regina (Queen) orchestrates the entire family

The key innovation: Guardians ONLY do QA. They never write code - they verify it.
This separation creates a self-reviewing system where mistakes are caught before
they reach the codebase.

In this talk, I'll share:

1. ARCHITECTURE: How we designed 16 agents to work as a coordinated team
2. MCP INTEGRATION: Using MCP's tool annotations and multi-server patterns at scale
3. PRODUCTION LESSONS: Real challenges building two SaaS apps with CervellaSwarm
4. PATTERNS: Reusable approaches for multi-agent MCP orchestration

Attendees will learn practical patterns for scaling MCP beyond single-agent
use cases, with code examples and architecture diagrams from a system
that's been in daily production use.

The future of AI development isn't one assistant - it's a team.
